Profound Leadership
===================

Have you had the opportunity to share a team with someone who doesn't speak often, but whenever they do it's absolute gold?  Maybe they're an expert in a specific field and only weigh in when the rest of the team is approaching a challenge entirely wrong.  Or maybe their thoughts are consistent, well-timed and include much needed humor.  In any case, when this person speaks, they are listened to.  Their thoughts are anticipated and valued by the team at large in a way that no-one else's seem to be.  This person is (ever so subtly) profound.

A good leader is also profound.  Not always - but certainly when it matters.  And this balance - being profound when necessary as oppose to just another voice in the discussion - is very hard to maintain.  Leaders who try to be profound with each thought expressed will quickly find all of their words lose power.  Leaders who refrain from those riskier insights that may benefit the group can lose respect and influence.

Indeed, the ability to interject a profound thought at just the right time is a skill worth honing.  In leading a variety of groups, I've found that there are some situations which afford a better foundation for a profound thought than others.  Recognizing these situations is key in providing  as much value as possible to a team through personal insight.  This may involve providing a summary of thoughts multiple team members have expressed, introducing a new perspective or even making some executive decision in light of an ongoing discussion.  Each of these actions - and the many more that a leader could take - can easily be derailed if the team is not ready for profound leadership.

Considering all of this, it seems that honing one's ability to "be profound" can be difficult!  As leaders, we want to weigh in on every issue.  We want to help our teams whenever possible and provide as much perspective as we can muster.  While this is great (and the passion is important!), maybe it's not always the best approach.

### Don't sweat the little things
Perhaps this goes without saying, but not every team discussion is worth a profound thought.  While I would hope that a team of surgeons explores all options and perspectives before discussing options with a patient, the same profound leadership is probably not necessary when trying to decide on a pizza place for dinner.

This philosophy also applies to more practical discussions within a team.  Petty discussions are - quite frankly - not worth the energy required to interject with a breakthrough insight.  Leaders who fail to realize this try and lead their teams through every little decision which is frustrating and quickly becomes ineffective.

###Let the team work itself out
Nothing seems to beg for profound leadership like a team in stark disagreement.  When leading in such situations, it is so tempting to scramble for some sort of "let's all be friends" or "everyone's correct" insight.  While there are times where this is appropriate - especially if the discussion starts to get personal - there is also something to be said for letting the team work itself out.

That is, if discussion is respectful and - well - happening, it may be best to just sit back and watch. All teams are ineffective sometimes.  The best teams have just had more opportunities to practice being effective.  And one of the best ways to practice being effective is to work through a solidly ineffective situation.  As a leader, coddling your team and negating such an experience could actually hurt in the long run.

###You're not the only leader (hopefully)
Profound leadership is great; profound leadership from an entire team of people is effectively bliss.  Thus, it's important to give all team members the chance to be profound leaders themselves. It always seems to be the team member you're least expecting who shines the most in the face of great challenge.  If this person is always overshadowed by hasty insights from other leaders, the team as a whole is missing out.

On the other hand, there are some team members who can be consistently relied upon to provide insight in specific areas.  Maybe Joe knows everything about fire safety and can provide the perfect perspective on risk with a new project.  Or maybe Susan actually knows all of the best pizza places around and can pick the perfect one for a midnight snack.  In either case, there's safety and comfort in allowing these team members to show their strengths.  Providing lesser (though sometimes seemingly more profound) insight would be a disservice to these team members and the group as a whole.

### Choose your battles wisely
#### What you're passionate about is what really matters and what you'll be most effective in discussing.
Inevitably, the areas where you will be able to provide the most valuable insight are those areas you are most passionate about.  Passion is both hard to mask and hard to fake.  As such, it is best used to your advantage as what can set your insight apart from the drone of other thoughts bombarding the team.

If a thought arises that genuinely makes you smile or - better yet - thoroughly excited, you'd best express it.  Quickly.  The team will appreciate the well-timed insight as much as your profound leadership in delivering it to them.


Sometimes being profound is seen as the sort of "magic" of leadership.  It's the ability to provide a voice when it's needed and a thought when it counts most.  However, how often profound insights are appropriate depends almost entirely on the team that one is leading.  While there are strategies for recognizing when you - as a leader - can be most effective, they pale in comparison to the effect that individuals can have on a team and it's reception of your insights.  The best teams will adapt to the style of a truly effective, profound leader in the same way that the leader's insights come to fit the team.  How do you provide profound leadership?
