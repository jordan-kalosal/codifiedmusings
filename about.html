        <h2>About my blog</h2>
        <p class="message">
          Hey there! Welcome to my personal blog: Codified Musings!  This site is a compilation of my thoughts (or musings) on a variety of topics.  As you can probably tell by the categories above, I divide my work into three main groups: Economics, Leadership and Web Development.  I write to teach, inspire and - perhaps more than anything else - codify my own understanding of complex topics.  To get a better grasp of the purpose of this blog, check out my very first blog post: Hello, world.

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
        Though seemingly disparate, my passions lie in web development, user experience design and education.  To satiate my interests, I manage a small web development company - Kalosal Solutions - which builds web applications and mobile apps with a variety of applications.  From building fundraising platforms for NGO's to crafting ubiquitous mobile apps in the field of education technology, we have a blast creating usable solutions to otherwise formidable challenges.</p>
        <p>More recently, I've become a cofounder of EditRevise - a feedback on demand service that currently provides web applications to connect freelance editors with content writers across the world.</p>
        <p>On the personal front, I'm a huge fan of both Twenty One Pilots and apple juice.  I believe that the best measure of value in an experience is how different it is from all other experiences one has.  As such, I enjoy learning just about anything from just about anyone.</p>
