# Leading By Example
“In your own words, please describe what defines an effective leader”.  This was the question asked of dozens of candidates I had to opportunity to interview for a leadership position recently.  The question is intentionally generic and truly standout answers are usually the mark of an effective leader.  Almost all of the answers, however, involve some element of: “A good leader leads by example”.

We’ve all heard this before.  While the concept of leading by example is nothing new - it nonetheless seems to be important and accessible to everyone.  Without much exception, the <i>best</i> leaders always seem to lead by example.  So what does it mean to lead by example?

Let’s start with the basics: what exactly are these leaders an example <i>of</i>?  Digging deeper, there seems to something about these individuals that the rest of us want to emulate; there are some qualities they embody that we feel are worth being held up as an example to our teams, peers or even society as a whole.

One quality that I inevitably find in those who truly lead by example is a strong sense of personal leadership.  These individuals are willing and able to effectively stand up for what they believe in.  They are able to express themselves with integrity.  These leaders have convictions and morals that they hold themselves to, even when no-one else is watching.    This is exemplified in the manner with which they consider all decisions; hard choices are made only after the opinions and personalities of all those who will be affected are carefully weighed.  In such cases, a leader’s personal preference is emphasized no more than any other team member’s as it truly is no more important.

In this way a personal leader is courageous.  A personal leader trusts the desires and sentiments of those she is leading because she fully understands them, even if she does not agree with them.  Further, such leadership requires empathy - an ability to relate with and come to know those you are working with so as to gain the ability to better understand how outcomes or situations will affect each individual personally.  Finally, without fail, personal leaders exude passion.  They have a passion for their own beliefs and a passion for the people they are leading.  Governing both of these is a heartfelt understanding that each individual’s passions and beliefs are just as important as the next if for no other reason than each has a person associated with it.

So a personal leader is one who is able to effectively stand up for herself and her team - including their beliefs and convictions - with integrity, time and time again.  A trait of someone who leads by example is the ability to do all of this personal leadership stuff in a way that is respected, admired and (indeed) actively emulated by others.

In this way, I’ve found that someone who leads by example is about so much more than just getting stuff done.  At (severe) risk of becoming too vague, those who lead by example are really just model human beings.  For this reason, these leaders aren’t always correct and don’t always come up with the right answer - a human never would.  These leaders make mistakes and then react appropriately, responsibly and respectably.  These leaders are proud of and happy for others when they see success, even if it is in light of the leader’s own mishap or failure.  In short, someone who leads by example is truly devoted to her team and those individuals who comprise it.  She respects these individuals the same way (and certainly no less) than she respects herself.  This is what provides the foundation for a beautifully cohesive, effective and joyous team.

As such, those who lead by example are so often not <i>trying</i> to be leaders.  Instead, they are just trying to be friends, family, teachers or students.  They just happen to be so darn good at it that they inspire the rest of us to reflect, step up our own game and become better people in the process.

So I guess to answer the question, those who lead by example are simply consistent models of really good people (about what you’d expect, right?).  They are worth emulating, they are worth following and they are always an inexplicably fulfilling joy to merely be around.  Who leads you by example?
