## About this repo
This repo simply contains the code for my blog at codifiedmusings.com.  The blog is generated with Jekyll (http://jekyllrb.com/)
and I make the code available for anyone looking to get started.  I'll strive to keep this repo up to date with each update to
the blog.  However, I don't do that fancy "host your site via github" stuff.
